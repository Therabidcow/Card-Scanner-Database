# Card Scanner + Database

Hi all.

I'm only trying to put together a simple application that will be using a camera or scanner to input card data into either a spreadsheet or database and retain that information.

The cards that I will be using for now will be from 'Wizards of the Coast: Magic the Gathering'. With this in mind would I need to compile a database of all available cards and what they look like as some can only be vaguely different as they can have similar/ same artwork, but foil versions and different revisions of the same card.

Thank you for your time.
